# Image to JSON Demo

This is a demonstration of the `img-to-json` library. This project contains a folder with 3 JPEG images of sample resumes (these are not real people).

Be sure that the `Demo.Cli` project is selected as the start up project, and then click debug. The project will iterate over each resume image and utilize the `img-to-json` library to extract data from each.
